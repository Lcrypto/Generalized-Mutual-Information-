# Generalized-Mutual-Information
Achievable Rates: Mutial Information (MI) and Generalize Mutial Information (GMI)
from Dr. Tobias Fehenberger https://www.fehenberger.de


When to use (symbolwise) MI and when to use GMI


For a given input and a memoryless channel, the MI is the largest achievable rate. If you do not want to make restrictions on the receiver and its decoder, use MI. If you consider a receiver with binary decoding and iterations between demapper and decoder are not allowed, GMI is an achievable rate (MI is in general not!).
